# Setup the Development Environment

## Lab Scenario

As one of the developers at Contoso, you know that setting up your development environment is an important step before starting to build your Azure IoT solution. You know that Microsoft provides a number of tools that can be used to develop and support your IoT solutions and that some decisions should be made about which tools your team will use. You will prepare a work environment that the team can use to develop your IoT solution, both on the Azure cloud side and for your local work environment.

After some discussion, your team has made the following high-level decisions about the dev environment:

* Operating System: Windows 10 will be used as the OS. Windows is used by most of your team, so it was a logical choice. You note that Azure IoT services support other operating systems (such as Mac OS and Linux), and Microsoft provides supporting documentation for those members of the team who choose one of these alternatives.
* General Coding Tools: Visual Studio Code and Azure CLI will be used as the primary coding tools. Both of these tools support extensions for IoT that leverage the Azure IoT SDKs.
* IoT Edge Tools: Docker Desktop Community and Python will be used to support custom IoT Edge module development.

In support of these decisions, you will be setting up the following environment:

* Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 15063 or later). Including
  * 4GB â€“ 8GB system RAM (higher the better for Docker)
  * Hyper-V and Containers features of Windows must be enabled.
  * BIOS-level hardware virtualization support must be enabled in the BIOS settings.

  > **Note**: When setting up the development environment on a virtual machine, the VM environment must support nested virtualization - [nested virtualization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization)

* Azure CLI (current/latest)
* .NET Core 3.1.200 (or later) SDK
* VS Code (latest)
* Python 3.7 (not 3.8)
* Docker Desktop Community 2.1.0.5 (or later) set to Linux Containers
* Power BI Desktop (for data visualization)
* IoT Extensions for VS Code and Azure CLI

> **Note**: A virtual machine has been created for this course that provides a majority of the tools specified above. The instructions below support using the prepared VM or setting up the development environment locally using your PC.

## In This Lab

In this lab you will:

* Install the base tools and products that will be used during the labs in this course.
* Install the Azure IoT extensions for Azure CLI and Visual Studio Code.
* Verify your development environment setup

    telemetry                           1.0.4

    Extensions:
    azure-cli-iot-ext                   0.8.9
    ```

1. Validate the **.NET Core 3.x SDK** installation by running the following command that will output the version number for the currently installed version of the .NET Core SDK.

    ```cmd/sh
    dotnet --version
    ```

1. The `dotnet --version` command will output the version of the .NET Core SDK that is currently installed. This must be .NET Core 3.1 or higher.

Your development environment should be now setup!

### Exercise 3: Set Up Course Lab Files and Alternative Tools

A number of the labs in this course rely on pre-built resources, such as a code project that can be used as a starting point for the lab activity. We provide access to these lab resources through the use of a GitHub project. In addition to resources that directly support the course labs (the resources contained in the GitHub project), there are tools that can be used to support learning opportunities outside the actual course. The instructions below lead you through the configuration of both these resource types.

#### Task 1: Download Course Lab Files

Microsoft has created a GitHub repo to provide access to lab resource files. Having these files local to the dev environment is required in some cases and convenient in many others. In this task you will be downloading and extracting the contents of the repo within your development environment.

1. In your Web browser, navigate to the following location: [https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-220-Microsoft-Azure-IoT-Developer](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-220-Microsoft-Azure-IoT-Developer)

1. On the right side of the page, click **Clone or download**, and then click **Download ZIP**.

1. To save the ZIP file to your dev environment, click **Save**.

1. Once the file has been saved, click **Open folder**.

1. Right-click the saved ZIP file, and then click **Extract all**

1. Click **Browse**, and then navigate to folder location that is convenient to access.

1. To extract the files, click **Extract**.

    Be sure to make note of where you located the files.

#### Task 2: Install Azure PowerShell Module

> **Note**: The lab activities in this course do NOT have you using PowerShell, however, you may see sample code in reference documents that use PowerShell. If you want to run PowerShell code, you can use the following instructions to complete the installation steps.

Azure PowerShell is a set of cmdlets for managing Azure resources directly from the PowerShell command line. Azure PowerShell is designed to make it easy to learn and get started with, but provides powerful features for automation. Written in .NET Standard, Azure PowerShell works with PowerShell 5.1 on Windows, and PowerShell 6.x and higher on all platforms.

> **Warning**:  You can't have both the AzureRM and Az modules installed for PowerShell 5.1 for Windows at the same time. If you need to keep AzureRM available on your system, install the Az module for PowerShell Core 6.x or later. To do this, install PowerShell Core 6.x or later and then follow these instructions in a PowerShell Core terminal.

1. Decide if you wish to install the Azure PowerShell module for just the current user (recommended approach) or for all users.

1. Launch the PowerShell terminal of your choice - if you are installing for all users you must launch an elevated PowerShell session either by either selecting **run as administrator** or with the **sudo** command on macOS or Linux.

1. To only install for the current user, enter the following command:

    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

    or to install for all users on a system, enter the following command:

    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope AllUsers
    ```

1. By default, the PowerShell gallery isn't configured as a trusted repository for PowerShellGet. The first time you use the PSGallery you see the following prompt:

    ```output
    Untrusted repository

    You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change
    its InstallationPolicy value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet.

    Are you sure you want to install the modules from 'PSGallery'?
    [Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"):
    ```

1. Answer **Yes** or **Yes to All** to continue with the installation.

    The Az module is a rollup module for the Azure PowerShell cmdlets. Installing it downloads all of the available Azure Resource Manager modules, and makes their cmdlets available for use.

> **Note**: If the **Az** module is already installed, you can update to the latest version using:
> 
> ```powershell
> Update-Module -Name Az
> ```
